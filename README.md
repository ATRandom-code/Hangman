# Hangman

The game will generate a random word from a list of words, and the player will have a certain number of tries to guess the word correctly. If the player doesn't guess the word correctly within the allowed number of tries, the game will end.

Here's how the game could work:

The game generates a random word from a list of words.
The player is given a certain number of tries to guess the word.
The player enters a guess for the word.
If the guess is correct, the game ends and the player wins.
If the guess is incorrect, the game subtracts one from the number of remaining tries and goes back to step 3.
If the player runs out of tries, the game ends and the player loses.
